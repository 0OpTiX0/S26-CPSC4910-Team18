For the FrontEnd Team:

Sorry for not explaining how to work with tailwind. There has been a lot on my plate lately and its
been hard to manage all of my other projects along with this one. I completed the setup for tailwind so all 
you'll need to do when developing this part of the project is the following


1. When developing css, you'll need to have a second terminal running this comand in the server's "Frontend" directory:  
      -->    npx @tailwindcss/cli -i styles.css -o output.css --watch 






2. Begin coding. You should be able to see changes when you visit http://<server_public_ip>




Hope this helped and sorry for not explaining. Let me know if you run into any issues

Your friend,
Joseph
